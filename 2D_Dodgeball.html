          2D Dodgeball is a game that aims to bring gym class to the 2D
          platform! A game for all of the not-so athletic to take revenge on the
          jocks that embarrased them in real life dodgeball. The game is simple,
          2 Players, 1 court, 2 ball spitting pipes on each side, and all of the
          chaotic dodgeball fun you could ask for. The game starts with one ball
          in the middle of the court which the players race to grab, the users
          will toss the ball back and forth trying to hit each other with it and
          get points. You can get points by either hitting the other player with
          a ball, or by catching a ball that the enemy player throws at you,
          first to five points declares the winner. Other game modes will be
          included along with the classic game mode such as a 2v2 team based
          dodgeball game where you must knock the two players out however, both
          teams have the ability to revive their partner when their partner goes
          down, and the other game mode will be a practice mode where the user
          can practice catching the balls, throwing the balls off walls and
          mastering different angles, and trying to master other skills that
          come with being a dodgeball master.

          The 2v2 game mode will be played a little bit differently from the
          original. Since there are two players it will be set up so that when a
          player gets hit the player is knocked down, and their teammate will be
          able to revive them. This can happen as long as one teammate is alive
          making this game mode more of a survival feeling mode with high
          intensity. Once both players are knocked down the opposing team wins
          since nobody can revive the players. Players will be able to pull off
          certain tasks that would not be possible in the regular game mode such
          as being able to pass the ball to a teammate however the teammate must
          catch the ball just like if it was being thrown at the player from an
          enemy. This allows for more of a skill cap in team mode and requires
          the players to think about what how they coordinate and are more
          involved in the teamwork aspect of the game.

          The classic game mode is a 1 v 1 match up that will test the users
          wits and reaction time by trying to out play the opponent with fast
          paced dodgeball gameplay. The game starts with one ball on the floor
          and as the game goes on more and more balls are launched onto the
          court from the cannons. The way in which balls are added to the court
          is completely randomized. The canons will fire at a random angle with
          randomized power, and it will come from a randomized cannon. This will
          make the game increasingly chaotic and skill based since there is no
          cooldown in which players can throw the ball. The way you score points
          in this game mode is by either hitting the opponent or catching an
          opponentâ€™s ball that was thrown. Once a point is scored the game is
          reset back to one ball, and the players are returned to the start
          positions. The first player to five points is the winner winner
          chicken dinner!
